# Cloud Observability & Automated Response Platform

This project simulates a cloud-based observability pipeline that ingests
system events, analyzes them for anomalies or rule-based conditions, and
triggers automated responses. The goal is to demonstrate real-world DevOps
and security engineering concepts such as monitoring, alerting, automation,
and infrastructure-as-code in a simplified environment.
